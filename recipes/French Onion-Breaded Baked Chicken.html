    <p>I make a lot of chicken recipes but none have received the praise I've gotten for this!! This is the most moist thing ever! </p>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
    <p>Mix bread crumbs and dry soup mix together in a bowl.</p>
    <p>Mix mayonnaise and garlic paste together in a separate bowl. Microwave on high to thin out consistency, 20 to 30 seconds.</p>
    <p>Brush chicken breasts with the mayonnaise mixture. Cover with the crumb mixture. Place on a baking sheet.</p>
    <p>Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
